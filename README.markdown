# Why this
This my fork of msanders/snipmate.vim. I add the multiple level expansion, which I
badly need in writing html and xml. I also add more snippets I used and I try to
merge the pull request of msanders/snipmate.vim

Quickly install with:

    git clone git://github.com/acevery/snipmate.vim.git
	cd snipmate.vim
	cp -R * ~/.vim
