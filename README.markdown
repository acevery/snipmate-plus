# Why this #
This my fork of msanders/snipmate.vim. I add the nested snippet expansion, which I
badly need in writing html and xml. I also add more snippets I used and I try to
merge the pull request of msanders/snipmate.vim

# Quickly install with #
Install [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#readme) if you haven't already. Then install snipmate as a bundle:
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/acevery/snipmate-plus.git
